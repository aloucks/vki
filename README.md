# VKI

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/aloucks/aloucks/_apis/build/status/aloucks.vki?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/aloucks/aloucks/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

VKI is _currently_ a [WebGPU](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb)
implementation, inspired by [WGPU](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) and
modeled after [Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn).

## Should I use this?

VKI is hobby project for learning how to build a sane abstraction layer
over the Vulkan API. You probably want to use
[WGPU-RS](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) or
[Rendy](https://github.com/amethyst/rendy).

## Does it work?

Yes! See the [examples](examples) directory for more interesting things.

## What does VKI mean?

The `VK` is for Vulkan and the `I` was chosen randomly! I'll probably
rename it eventually.
